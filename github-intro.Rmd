```{r libs, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Load Libraries

Insert a code chunk to load the `tidyverse`, `unvotes`, and `lubridate` packages.
Use the `knitr` option `include = FALSE`. 

## Plot the Data

Choose a country in the data set and replicate what we did in class by 
substituting that country for Australia. Knit the document so that a new
`github-intro.md` file is created, add it to the repo, commit it, and push it
to github.
